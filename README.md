# PCAParse
PCAP Parsing

Welcome to our GitHub! The program we have created is called PCAParse if you haven't noticed already.
It was designed to be a multi-faceted tool that helps filter through PCAPs without having to open Wireshark
nor do you need to fumble around with tshark syntax. It does not replace the use of Wireshark or tshark alike,
however it will assist with quick searches/data dumps. This tool was made with security analysts in mind but is
not exclusive to the role, our program will truly work for anybody who needs to review packet captures.

Current Features of the Program include:
Live Capture, Reviewing Existing Captures, Dumping data to CSV

Upcoming Features to be Added/Perfected:
Search Functionality
